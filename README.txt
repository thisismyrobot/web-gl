This project would not have got off the ground if it wasn't for the excellent pyglet example code by Txema Vicente on the following Google Groups thread http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-users/browse_thread/thread/0a2ecebae56f0c58

This code allowed me to unlock the magic of 3d projections after I had hit a wall moving beyond my original 2d ortho projections. Thank you, Txema.
